# Web App Fix Documentation - January 10, 2025

## Issue
- Web app was returning "Internal Server Error" when accessing http://localhost:8002
- Root cause: FileResponse was using relative path 'static/login.html' instead of absolute path

## Fix Applied
Changed line 132 in `/Users/tshoush/Desktop/Marriot/web_app/app.py`:

### Before:
```python
return FileResponse('static/login.html')
```

### After:
```python
return FileResponse(os.path.join(static_dir, 'login.html'))
```

## Result
- Web app now properly serves the login page
- Application is running successfully on port 8002
- No more Internal Server Error

## Technical Details
- The `static_dir` variable is already defined at line 54 as an absolute path
- Using `os.path.join()` ensures proper path construction across platforms
- This fix ensures the FileResponse can find the login.html file regardless of the current working directory
