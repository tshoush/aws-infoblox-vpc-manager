# InfoBlox Connection Management Improvements

## Current State
- Single session instance is maintained throughout program lifetime
- Connection pooling is handled automatically by requests.Session()
- No connection reset between operations

## Understanding "Resetting dropped connection" Messages

The log messages you're seeing like:
```
DEBUG - Resetting dropped connection: 10.82.108.28
```

This is **NORMAL behavior** and does NOT indicate a problem with your connection management. Here's what's happening:

1. **Server-side timeout**: The InfoBlox server likely has an idle timeout (commonly 30-60 seconds) and closes inactive connections
2. **urllib3 detection**: The requests library's connection pool (urllib3) detects the closed connection
3. **Automatic reconnection**: A new connection is transparently established for the next request

This is actually the connection pooling working correctly - it's:
- Detecting that the previous connection was closed by the server
- Automatically creating a new connection
- Handling this transparently without failing your requests

The "200" status codes in your logs confirm all requests are succeeding.

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Connection Pool Tuning
Add custom adapter with connection pool settings:

```python
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry import Retry

def __init__(self, grid_master: str, username: str, password: str, api_version: str = "v2.13.1"):
    self.grid_master = grid_master
    self.username = username
    self.password = password
    self.api_version = api_version
    self.base_url = f"https://{grid_master}/wapi/{api_version}"
    
    # Create session with optimized settings
    self.session = requests.Session()
    self.session.auth = (username, password)
    self.session.verify = False
    
    # Configure connection pooling
    adapter = HTTPAdapter(
        pool_connections=10,  # Number of connection pools to cache
        pool_maxsize=20,      # Maximum number of connections to save in the pool
        max_retries=Retry(
            total=3,
            backoff_factor=0.3,
            status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504]
        )
    )
    self.session.mount('https://', adapter)
    self.session.mount('http://', adapter)
    
    # Set keep-alive headers
    self.session.headers.update({
        'Connection': 'keep-alive',
        'Keep-Alive': 'timeout=300, max=100'
    })
```

### 2. Connection Health Check
Add a method to verify connection health:

```python
def check_connection(self) -> bool:
    """Check if the connection to InfoBlox is healthy"""
    try:
        # Make a lightweight API call
        response = self._make_request('GET', 'networkview?_max_results=1')
        return response.status_code == 200
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Connection health check failed: {e}")
        return False

def ensure_connection(self):
    """Ensure connection is healthy, reconnect if needed"""
    if not self.check_connection():
        logger.info("Reconnecting to InfoBlox...")
        # Close existing session
        self.session.close()
        # Create new session
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.session.auth = (self.username, self.password)
        self.session.verify = False
        # Re-apply adapter settings...
```

### 3. Batch Operations
For multiple network operations, consider batching:

```python
def create_networks_batch(self, networks: List[Dict], network_view: str = "default") -> List[Dict]:
    """Create multiple networks in a single request using InfoBlox batch operations"""
    batch_request = []
    
    for network in networks:
        batch_request.append({
            "method": "POST",
            "object": "network",
            "data": {
                "network": network['cidr'],
                "network_view": network_view,
                "comment": network.get('comment', ''),
                "extattrs": network.get('extattrs', {})
            }
        })
    
    # Send batch request
    response = self._make_request('POST', 'request', data=batch_request)
    return response.json()
```

### 4. Connection Timeout Settings
Add timeout configuration:

```python
def _make_request(self, method: str, endpoint: str, params: Optional[Dict] = None, 
                  data: Optional[Dict] = None, timeout: Optional[int] = None) -> requests.Response:
    """Make HTTP request to InfoBlox WAPI with timeout"""
    url = f"{self.base_url}/{endpoint}"
    
    # Default timeout if not specified
    if timeout is None:
        timeout = (10, 300)  # (connection timeout, read timeout)
    
    try:
        if method.upper() == 'GET':
            response = self.session.get(url, params=params, timeout=timeout)
        elif method.upper() == 'POST':
            response = self.session.post(url, json=data, params=params, timeout=timeout)
        # ... rest of methods
```

### 5. Connection Context Manager
Implement a context manager for automatic cleanup:

```python
def __enter__(self):
    """Enter context manager"""
    return self

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    """Exit context manager - close session"""
    self.session.close()
    logger.info("InfoBlox session closed")

# Usage:
with InfoBloxClient(grid_master, username, password) as ib_client:
    vpc_manager = VPCManager(ib_client)
    # ... do operations
# Session automatically closed
```

### 6. Performance Monitoring
Add connection performance metrics:

```python
import time

def _make_request(self, method: str, endpoint: str, params: Optional[Dict] = None, 
                  data: Optional[Dict] = None) -> requests.Response:
    """Make HTTP request with performance monitoring"""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    try:
        # ... existing request code ...
        
        # Log performance metrics
        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
        logger.debug(f"API call to {endpoint} took {elapsed_time:.2f}s")
        
        # Warn if request is slow
        if elapsed_time > 5.0:
            logger.warning(f"Slow API response: {endpoint} took {elapsed_time:.2f}s")
        
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
        logger.error(f"API call to {endpoint} failed after {elapsed_time:.2f}s: {e}")
        raise
```

## Summary

The current implementation already maintains a persistent connection through the session object. The suggested improvements above would:

1. Optimize connection pooling parameters
2. Add connection health monitoring
3. Enable batch operations for better performance
4. Configure appropriate timeouts
5. Ensure proper resource cleanup
6. Add performance monitoring

These enhancements would make the connection management more robust and performant, especially when dealing with large numbers of networks.
